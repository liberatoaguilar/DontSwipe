Prevent people from snooping around your phone! DontSwipe uses an activator gesture to prevent people from swiping when showing them a photo and going to other applications. DontSwipe works system-wide.

DontSwipe disables:

- Any swiping or taping gestures on the screen
- Volume button interactions
- Home button interactions
- Home gesture interactions
- Lock button interactions
- Notification Center interactions
- Control Center interactions
- Reachability

A red flash will be seen when DontSwipe is activated followed by a small red border showing up on the screen indicating DontSwipe is active. By using the activator again a green flash will appear to indicate that your screen is back to normal.
